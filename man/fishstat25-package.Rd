\title{Global Fishery and Aquaculture Statistics}
\description{
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) FishStat
database is the leading source of global fishery and aquaculture statistics
and provides unique information for sector analysis and monitoring.

This package provides the global production data from all fisheries and
aquaculture in R format, ready for analysis.
}
\details{
\emph{Production tables:}
\tabular{ll}{
  \code{\link{aquaculture}} \tab aquaculture production\cr
  \code{\link{capture}}     \tab capture production\cr
  \code{\link{production}}  \tab aquaculture and capture production
}
\emph{Lookup tables:}
\tabular{ll}{
  \code{\link{area}}        \tab fishing areas\cr
  \code{\link{country}}     \tab countries and territories\cr
  \code{\link{environment}} \tab aquaculture environments\cr
  \code{\link{measure}}     \tab units of measurement\cr
  \code{\link{source}}      \tab sources of production\cr
  \code{\link{species}}     \tab taxonomic groups\cr
  \code{\link{status}}      \tab status of data entries
}
}
\note{
The data in the package were downloaded from the FAO
\href{https://www.fao.org/fishery/static/Data/}{data server} and imported
into R. The R package version indicates the version of FishStat data it
includes. Column names have been simplified to facilitate quick exploration
and plotting in R.

An effort has been made to describe each table in the corresponding R help
page. However, the official and authoritative documentation of the FishStat
database is found on the FAO
\href{https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/fishstat}{FishStat} website.

The example below demonstrates how the FishStat data can be used to produce
an overview of global fisheries and aquaculture. The combination of FishStat
and the R environment can also be very efficient for analyses that focus on
selected areas, countries, species, and/or taxonomic groups.

\section{Joining Tables}{

Production tables can be joined with lookup tables using the
\code{\link{merge}} function, as demonstrated in the help page examples for
\code{\link{aquaculture}} and \code{\link{capture}} production. The column
names in this package have been designed to allow automatic inference of
which columns to join, and the resulting table will have unique column names.

The \code{merge} function is generally useful for joining tables, but other
join methods are available in R that can be faster but require either
additional packages or more coding. The \code{\link{production}} example uses
square brackets and the \code{match} function to add one lookup column at a
time to the production table. Compared to the slower \code{merge} function,
this saves time, both for users and CRAN servers running maintenance tests.

Rather than optimizing speed or memory footprint, one can optimize
convenience by constructing a full table with all data records and all
columns:\preformatted{
prod.all <- merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(production,
                  area), country), measure), source), species), status)
cap.all <- merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(capture,
                 area), country), measure), species), status)
aqua.all <- merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(aquaculture,
                  area), country), environment), measure), species), status)}

Popular paradigms for joining tables include:
\itemize{
  \item Base R, where \code{merge} returns a \code{data.frame}.
  \item The \code{dplyr} package, where \code{inner_join} returns a
        \code{tibble}.
  \item The \code{data.table} package, where \code{merge} returns a
        \code{data.table}.
}
}

\examples{
head(production)

# Analyze production measured in tonnes
prod <- production[production$measure == "Q_tlw" & production$value > 0,]

# Fast merge yearbook and inlandmarine columns
prod$yearbook <- species$yearbook[match(prod$species, species$species)]
prod$inlandmarine <- area$inlandmarine[match(prod$area, area$area)]

# Select SOFIA species, excluding mammals, reptiles, and plants
prod <- prod[grep("Fish, crustaceans and molluscs", prod$yearbook, fixed=TRUE),]

# Determine origin
prod$origin <- ifelse(prod$source == "CAPTURE", "Capture", "Aquaculture")
prod$w <- ifelse(prod$inlandmarine == "Marine areas", "marine", "inland")
prod$origin <- paste0(prod$origin, " (", prod$w, ")")
cbind(sort(unique(prod$origin)))

# World capture fisheries and aquaculture production
x <- xtabs(value~year+origin, aggregate(value~year+origin, prod, sum))
x <- x[,c(2,1,4,3)] / 1e6
library(areaplot)
areaplot(x, legend=TRUE, args.legend=list(x="topleft"), ylab="million tonnes")
}

The package on CRAN provides the latest FishStat data, within a few weeks
after an official FAO data release. For research and reference purposes,
packages containing older data releases are available on GitHub with
descriptive names such as fishstat21 and fishstat22, containing the FAO
FishStat data releases from 2021 and 2022: \preformatted{
install_github("https://github.com/sofia-taf/fishstat21")
